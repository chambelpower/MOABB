hparams has the base yaml file for this dataset running with just the cutcat augmenter.

The BCIAUTP300.py has the class i created to handle the importation of the dataset to moabb.

The preprocessing.py file is a file that is in /Python/Python310/Lib/site-packages/moabb/datasets/preprocessing.py, and i think i should not have changed it but this was the only way i could make it work.
